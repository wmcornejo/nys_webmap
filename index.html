        <h1>Impact of Highway Traffic on Air Quality and Respiratory Health</h1>
          <p>The relationship between highway traffic and 
            air quality is often overlooked. However, highway traffic can significantly
            impact air quality, leading to increased levels of pollutants such as
            nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic 
            compounds (VOCs). These pollutants can have serious health effects,
            particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly,
            and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health impacts
            of highway traffic can be particularly pronounced in low-income and
            minority communities, which are often located near major highways and
            transportation corridors. These communities may be exposed to higher
            levels of air pollution, leading to increased rates of respiratory
            illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>

          <p>NYSERDA, in collaboration with the Climate Working Justice Group (CWJG) 
            and the CLCPA, have provided a rich dataset for categorizing disadvantaged 
            communities for 2023. Factors such as pollution exposure, historical 
            disinvestment of land, climate vulnerabilities and socioeconomic factors 
            provide a chance to map varying economic and environmental conditions in New York State. 
            This project aims to visualize these disparities and empower policymakers 
            and community members to better understand the challenges.</p>
