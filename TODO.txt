What is the purpose of your web page? what do you want to convey?
i want to focus on public health, and how it intersects with environmental
situations
how traffic impacts the air we breathe and leads to diseases across the state

find most vulnerable communities and tie it with something else as a bubblemap



factors i like:
low vegetative color
pm2.5
benzene - caused by industrial activities
drive time to healthcare
projected heat days

map ideas:
heart attack + drive time to healthcare

traffic_truck_highways/traffic_number_vehicles -> pm2.5, benzene -> asthma, cocpd
    for this idea, have it all be in one map, with three types of data toggable(?)
flooding -> contamination -> health risks

add extensions to maps (search)



questions/tasks:
what is the best coloring scheme for the map 1 chloropleths?
add search to map1
Draw how your web page will look like, find inspiration
look at suncodeearth
forget about layer button, let other buttons control which show and let user decide
no hover. just when you click theres stats 

add title to click
what should show when hovered?
Update the color scheme either preferably sequential or diverging  
(using ColorBrewer - https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=BrBG&n=3). 
Based on your data normalize it as you are aiming at choropleth instead presenting raw values, 
also reduce the areas where you don't have a data with a more neutral transparent color and reduce the edge length or line width.
